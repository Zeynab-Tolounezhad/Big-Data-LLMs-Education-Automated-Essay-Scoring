# Automated Essay Scoring with Enhanced LLM-Integrated NPCR Architecture:
Implemented and extended the NPCR model (Xie et al., COLING 2022) for automated essay scoring using large language models (LLMs). Introduced architectural modifications and performed a comparative evaluation of multiple LLMs to identify optimal trade-offs between scoring accuracy and inference speed.
# NPCR Model 
( The overall framework of neural pairwise contrastive regression model for AES )
